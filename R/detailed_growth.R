#' Calculate between-census annual growth
#' 
#' Requires a data frame where separate measurements of the same tree appear
#' in different rows and returns a data frame containing annual growth between
#' each pair of consecutive measurements for each tree.
#' 
#' @param data A data frame containing repeated dbh measurements of trees. Must 
#' have a column named "tree_id" that contains unique tree ID values, a column
#' named "year" containing the year of the measurement, and a column named
#' "dbh" containing the dbh measurements. See built-in dataset \code{tree} for
#' an example.
#' @return A data frame containing between-census annual growth of each tree:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{tree_id}{unique identification code of the tree}
#'   \item{start_year}{first year of between-census period}
#'   \item{begin_size}{diameter at breast height at beginning of between-census
#'   period, in cm}
#'   \item{end_year}{last year of between-census period}
#'   \item{end_size}{diameter at breast height at end of between-census
#'   period, in cm}
#'   \item{annual_growth}{annual growth rate as average yearly increase in 
#'   diameter at breast height, in cm/year}
#'   \item{annual_bai}{annual basal area increment as average yearly increase
#'   in area at breast height, in cm^2/year}
#'   \item{size_corr_growth}{square root of \code{annual_growth} divided by
#'   \code{begin_size} to give somewhat normally distributed growth rates}
#'   \item{...}{any other columns that appeared in \code{data}}
#' }
